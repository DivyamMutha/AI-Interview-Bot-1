AI  MOCK INTERVIEW BOT
The AI Interview Bot is an innovative application developed to provide intelligent, interactive, 
and personalized interview preparation experiences. The system leverages Artificial 
Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning (ML) 
algorithms to simulate real-world interviews based on the candidate’s own resume.  
Unlike traditional interview preparation platforms, this system customizes the interview 
according to the user’s background, skills, and achievements extracted from the uploaded 
resume. After the mock interview, the bot generates detailed performance analytics including 
confidence level, communication clarity, and technical understanding. It also provides resume 
improvement feedback, highlighting issues like keyword optimization, grammar, and 
formatting for better ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility.  
By combining AI-driven intelligence with automated resume evaluation, this project aims to 
bridge the skill gap among students and job seekers. It offers a low-cost, scalable, and time 
efficient solution to enhance employability and prepare users for real-world job interviews.
